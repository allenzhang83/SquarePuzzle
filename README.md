# SquarePuzzle

Came across this puzzle on my daughter's math exercise. The puzzle can be found [here](http://authenticinquirymaths.blogspot.com/2012/05/playing-with-squares.html).

Her year 4 exercise was the easy version: find solutions for 5 squares.

I tried for an hour and couldn't find the pattern......

But hey! I'm a software engineer! I have my way to solve problems.

This code does not find the pattern, but it does produce the solution for given number of squares.
